# Tape Storage Optimization Visualization

## Overview
This project provides a visualization tool for optimizing tape storage by distributing files across multiple tapes. The user can input the number of tapes and the lengths of the files, and the tool will visualize the optimal distribution of files.

## Features
- **Dynamic Input**: Users can specify the number of tapes and the lengths of files they want to distribute.
- **Algorithm Selection**: Currently supports an optimal ordering algorithm for file distribution.
- **Color Themes**: Users can toggle between different color themes (Default, Rainbow, Blues).
- **Animation Speed Control**: Users can adjust the speed of the visualization animation.
- **Error Handling**: Displays error messages for invalid inputs.
- **Responsive Design**: The interface is designed to be user-friendly on various screen sizes.

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Enter the number of tapes (1-10).
3. Input the file lengths as a comma-separated list (e.g., `5,10,3`).
4. Select the desired algorithm and color theme.
5. Click on "Visualize" to see the distribution of files across the tapes.
6. Use the "Reset" button to clear the visualization and start over.
